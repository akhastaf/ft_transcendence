Main page of components/Home.tsx 
    -> ChannelList page {rooms [], selectRoomHandler, choosenChat, Notifications, function to createRoom}

    -> userList page 







    // to build entity 
        -> define the type (interface)
        -> const [rooms, setRooms] = useState<any>([]);
        -> in useaffect called function to get allRooms and then their users

        ( getAllRomsAndUsersApi()
        .then((roomsUsersData) => {
            setRooms(roomsUsersData.rooms);
            setUsers(roomsUsersData.users);
        })
        .catch((err) => console.log(err));)

// leaderboard

// i need friends for home page -> we have getAllDms in back but it returns array of channel modal . (adding friends block friend routes)
// souinia said its bad practice what we do to get id of chat room (front emit (create) ->  back emit id )
// throw an error if password given for protected channel is wrong

-- BETTER ROUTING 




i clicked on Room/user -> /channels/choosenChat.id     display chat with {of the room}

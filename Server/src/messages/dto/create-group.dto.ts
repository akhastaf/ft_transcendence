//** DTO (Data Transfer Object) schema. A DTO is an object that defines how the data will be sent over the network */
//*
//* The DTO on it's own is more of a guideline for the developer and those who consume the API to know what kind of shape the request body expects to be,
//* it doesn't actually run any validations on its own. However, with Typescript you can add in decorators from the class-validator library and and use
//* the built-in ValidationPipe and have validations run on your incoming requests so that only the expected request body can come in.
//* In short, the DTO is the definition of what the request should look like, but because JavaScript is a dynamic language, you can send in anything.
//* That's why libraries like class-validator and runtypes exist.
